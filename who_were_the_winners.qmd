```{r}
# Load libraries
library(DBI)
library(dplyr)
library(dbplyr)

# Connect to the DuckDB database
dir = here::here("../bren-eds213-data/database/database.db")
conn <- dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(), dbdir = dir)

# Reference the tables
eggs <- tbl(conn, "Bird_eggs")
nests <- tbl(conn, "Bird_nests")
observers <- tbl(conn, "Personnel")

# Join and compute total eggs per observer
top_observers <- eggs %>%
  inner_join(nests, by = "Nest_ID") %>% 
  inner_join(observers, by = join_by("Observer" == "Abbreviation")) %>% 
  group_by(Name) %>%
  summarise(total_eggs = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(desc(total_eggs)) %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = total_eggs, n = 3, with_ties = FALSE) 

# Show the result
print(top_observers)

# Show the generated SQL query
top_observers %>% show_query()
```
I only used a single R statement. It did not use an SQL Limit clause.
